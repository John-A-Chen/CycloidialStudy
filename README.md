# CycloidialStudy
This repository documents the design and development of a cycloidal drive system intended for high-torque, compact robotic and mechatronic applications. The project focuses on parametric CAD design in SolidWorks, manufacturing-aware geometry, tolerance control, and clear documentation suitable for replication or adaptation.
